Project: Algorithm for a Dog Identification App
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* * * * *


First steps towards developing an algorithm that could be used as part of a mobile or web app. 
The code accept any user-supplied image as input.
If a dog is detected in the image, it will provide an estimate of the
dog's breed. If a human is detected, it will provide an estimate of the
dog breed that is most resembling.


The notebook has the following steps
-   Import Datasets
-   Detect Humans
-   Detect Dogs
-   Create a CNN to Classify Dog Breeds (from Scratch)
-   Create a CNN to Classify Dog Breeds (using Transfer Learning)
-   Test
